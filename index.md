## Research activities  
I work on mathematical models of infectious diseases, focussed on childhood diseases and the public health impact of new vaccines. The focus of my current research is to develop dynamic models for respiratory synctial virus (RSV) transmission and vaccination, to inform target product profiles for RSV vaccine in low-income settings.  

I also work on a range of other projects related to estimating the public health impact of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine and second-generation malaria vaccines in malaria endemic areas.  

Before joining Imperial College London, I completed my PhD (2017) at the Research School of Population Health at the Australian National University. I have a BSc (Honours I, Applied Mathematics, 2009) from the University of Sydney.
